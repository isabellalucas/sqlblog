      <p>he word &quot;whale&quot; comes from the Old English wh&#230;l, related to the High German wal. Related forms are the Old Norse hvalr and the Swedish/Danish hval. The obsolete &quot;whalefish&quot; has a similar derivation, indicating a time when whales were thought to be fish. Other archaic English forms include wal, wale, whal, whalle, whaille, wheal, etc.[2]</p>    </div>

      <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>This article is about the group of flying insects. For other uses, see Bee (disambiguation).<br/>&quot;Anthophila&quot; redirects here. For the moth genus, see Anthophila (moth).</p><p>Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.[1][2] They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.</p>    </div>

      <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br/>For chickens as food, see Chicken (food). For the broader species of which chickens form a subspecies, see Red junglefowl. For other uses, see Chicken (disambiguation), Chooks (disambiguation), or Red junglefowl.</p><p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011.[1] Humans commonly keep chickens as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, more rarely, as pets.</p>    </div>
